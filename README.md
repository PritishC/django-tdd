django-tdd
==========

Learning Django through Harry Percival's TDD book.
I will be using Pytest instead of the classic unittest-style testing pattern. This means that I will have to use the pytest-django plugin.
Of course, this plugin has its benefits (less boilerplate) and issues (no multi-DB support, need to use django.test.TestCase there) but I'm using it because I started my TDD journey with Pytest.

More will be added to this readme as I progress.
